# SOC 2 Quality Guild

> Practitioner-driven standards for SOC 2 report reliability. A community creating standardized evaluation criteria to help GRC and TPRM practitioners assess how much weight to give a SOC 2 report when making vendor trust decisions.

The SOC 2 Quality Guild provides the SOC 2 Reliability Rubric — a practical framework with 11 signals across 3 pillars (Structure, Substance, Source) — plus a Tactical Response Guide and community-driven projects to improve audit quality across the ecosystem.
